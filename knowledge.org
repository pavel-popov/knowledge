*** Reading from closed channel is non-blocking

If you read from a closed channel then it will be successful
with the default value of the channel's type.

*Where it's useful?*

When organising shutdown logic: create a quit channel, in every spawned goroutine
select from quit channel and shutdown goroutine, then in the control flow close quit
channel on shutdown.
